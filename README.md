# Style
The [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) is a great resource for any questions about style. Check out their top ten tips for style and voice to understand the Microsoft conventions for capitalization, punctuation and other writing tips!

### Style
From the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/):
- Use few words 
- Write like you speak
- Project friendliness (use contractions)
- Get to the point fast
- Start statements with verbs to eliminate excess words
### Voice
Don't use the passive tense. There is a fun rule that makes it easy to identify the passive voice: if you add "by zombies" after the verb in the sentence and it still makes sense, you are using the passive tense. 
### Best practices
1. Reread what you've written
2. Read it aloud
3. Ask others to read and review it before sharing it with a wider audience.
