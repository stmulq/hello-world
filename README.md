Stephanie Mulqueen worked as a technical writer at Lytro, a VR startup that was acquired by Google, and at Apple and Light Labs. Before becoming a technical writer, she worked in computer animation for almost twenty years. She is always interested in learning something new and tries not to hover over her teenagers as they navigate college admissions and parallel parking!"
